@article{Yakhnin2007,
   abstract = {The origin of protein synthesis is one of the major riddles
              of molecular biology. It was proposed a decade ago that the
              ribosomal RNA evolved from an earlier RNA-replisome (a
              ribozyme fulfilling RNA replication) while transfer RNA
              (tRNA) evolved from a genomic replication origin. Applying
              these hypotheses, I suggest that protein synthesis arose for
              the purpose of segregating copy and template RNA during
              replication through the conventional formation of a
              complementary strand. Nascent RNA was scanned in 5' to 3'
              direction following the progress of replication. The base
              pairing of several tRNA-like molecules with nascent RNA
              released the replication intermediates trapped in duplex.
              Synthesis of random peptides evolved to fuel the turnover of
              tRNAs. Then the combination of replication-coupled peptide
              formation and the independent development of amino
              acid-specific tRNA aminoacylation resulted in template-based
              protein synthesis. Therefore, the positioning of tRNAs
              adjacent to each other developed for the purpose of
              replication rather than peptide synthesis. This hypothesis
              does not include either selection for useful peptides or
              specific recognition of amino acids at the initial evolution
              of translation. It does, however, explain a number of
              features of modern translation apparatus, such as the
              relative flexibility of genetic code, the number of proteins
              shared by the transcription and translation machines, the
              universal participation of an RNA subunit in
              co-translational protein secretion, 'unscheduled
              translation', and factor-independent translocation.
              Assistance of original ribosomes in keeping apart the
              nascent transcript from its template is still widely
              explored by modern bacteria and perhaps by other domains of
              life.},

              The persistent bacterial proteome organises around
              intermediary and RNA metabolism, and RNA-related information
              transfer, with a significant contribution to
              compartmentalisation. Despite inevitable losses during
              evolution, the extant persistent proteome displays functions
              present early on. Proteins coded by genes staying clustered
              in a majority of genomes constitute a network of mutual
              attraction made up of three concentric circles. The outer
              one, mostly devoted to metabolism, breaks into small pieces
              and fades away. The second, more continuous, one organises
              around class I tRNA synthetases. The well-connected inner
              circle comprises the ribosome and information transfer. This
              reflects the progressive construction of cells, starting
              from the metabolism of coenzymes, nucleotides and fatty
              acids-related molecules. Subsequently, a core set of
              aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases scaffolded around RNA, connected
              to cell division machinery and organised metabolism around
              translation. This remarkable organisation reflects the
              evolution of life from small molecules metabolism to the RNA
              world, suggesting that extant microorganisms carry the marks
              of the ancient processes that created life. Further analysis
              suggests that RNA degradation, associated to the presence of
              iron, still plays a role in extant metabolism, including the

@article{CavalierSmith2006,
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite great advances in clarifying the family
              tree of life, it is still not agreed where its root is or
              what properties the most ancient cells possessed--the most
              difficult problems in phylogeny. Protein paralogue trees can
              theoretically place the root, but are contradictory because
              of tree-reconstruction artefacts or poor resolution;
              ribosome-related and DNA-handling enzymes suggested one
              between neomura (eukaryotes plus archaebacteria) and
              eubacteria, whereas metabolic enzymes often place it within
              eubacteria but in contradictory places. Palaeontology shows
              that eubacteria are much more ancient than eukaryotes, and,
              together with phylogenetic evidence that archaebacteria are
              sisters not ancestral to eukaryotes, implies that the root
              is not within the neomura. Transition analysis, involving
              comparative/developmental and selective arguments, can
              polarize major transitions and thereby systematically
              exclude the root from major clades possessing derived
              characters and thus locate it; previously the 20 shared
              neomuran characters were thus argued to be derived, but
              whether the root was within eubacteria or between them and
              archaebacteria remained controversial. RESULTS: I analyze 13
              major transitions within eubacteria, showing how they can
              all be congruently polarized. I infer the first fully
              resolved prokaryote tree, with a basal stem comprising the
              new infrakingdom Glidobacteria (Chlorobacteria,
              Hadobacteria, Cyanobacteria), which is entirely
              non-flagellate and probably ancestrally had gliding
              motility, and two derived branches (Gracilicutes and
              Unibacteria/Eurybacteria) that diverged immediately
              following the origin of flagella. Proteasome evolution shows
              that the universal root is outside a clade comprising
              neomura and Actinomycetales (proteates), and thus lies
              within other eubacteria, contrary to a widespread assumption
              that it is between eubacteria and neomura. Cell wall and
              flagellar evolution independently locate the root outside
              Posibacteria (Actinobacteria and Endobacteria), and thus
              among negibacteria with two membranes. Posibacteria are
              derived from Eurybacteria and ancestral to neomura. RNA
              polymerase and other insertions strongly favour the
              monophyly of Gracilicutes (Proteobacteria, Planctobacteria,
              Sphingobacteria, Spirochaetes). Evolution of the
              negibacterial outer membrane places the root within
              Eobacteria (Hadobacteria and Chlorobacteria, both
              primitively without lipopolysaccharide): as all phyla
              possessing the outer membrane beta-barrel protein Omp85 are
              highly probably derived, the root lies between them and
              Chlorobacteria, the only negibacteria without Omp85, or
              possibly within Chlorobacteria. CONCLUSION: Chlorobacteria
              are probably the oldest and Archaebacteria the youngest
              bacteria, with Posibacteria of intermediate age, requiring
              radical reassessment of dominant views of bacterial
              evolution. The last ancestor of all life was a eubacterium
              with acyl-ester membrane lipids, large genome, murein
              peptidoglycan walls, and fully developed eubacterial
              molecular biology and cell division. It was a non-flagellate
              negibacterium with two membranes, probably a photosynthetic
              green non-sulphur bacterium with relatively primitive
              secretory machinery, not a heterotrophic posibacterium with
              one membrane.},

   abstract = {The division of the living world into three cellular
              domains, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, is now generally
              accepted. However, there is no consensus about the
              evolutionary relationships among these domains, because all
              of the proposed models have a number of more or less severe
              pitfalls. Another drawback of current models for the
              universal tree of life is the exclusion of viruses,
              otherwise a major component of the biosphere. Recently, it
              was suggested that the transition from RNA to DNA genomes
              occurred in the viral world, and that cellular DNA and its
              replication machineries originated via transfers from DNA
              viruses to RNA cells. Here, I explore the possibility that
              three such independent transfers were at the origin of
              Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, respectively. The reduction
              of evolutionary rates following the transition from RNA to
              DNA genomes would have stabilized the three canonical
              versions of proteins involved in translation, whereas the
              existence of three different founder DNA viruses explains
              why each domain has its specific DNA replication apparatus.
              In that model, plasmids can be viewed as transitional forms
              between DNA viruses and cellular chromosomes, and the
              formation of different levels of cellular organization
              (prokaryote or eukaryote) could be traced back to the nature
              of the founder DNA viruses and RNA cells.},

              tRNAs and additional protein factors, including aminoacyl
              tRNA synthetases. The ribosome provides the platform for
              proper assembly of mRNA, tRNAs and protein factors and
              carries the peptidyl-transferase activity. It consists of
              small and large subunits. The ribosomes are
              ribonucleoprotein particles with a ribosomal RNA core, to
              which multiple ribosomal proteins are bound. The sequence
              and structure of ribosomal RNAs, tRNAs, some of the
              ribosomal proteins and some of the additional protein
              factors are conserved in all kingdoms, underlying the common
              origin of the translation apparatus. Translation can be
              subdivided into several steps: initiation, elongation,
              termination and recycling. Of these, initiation is the most
              complex and the most divergent among the different kingdoms
              of life. A great amount of new structural, biochemical and
              genetic information on translation initiation has been
